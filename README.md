# RideFair

This is the development repository for RideFair, a Spark Fellowship 2020 project.

### Guidelines for branch names

All branch names must be divided into the following types:
  - feature
  - random
  
  ##### Examples:
  
  - If you work on a feature for creating a map view, name the branch "**feature-createMapView**".
  - If you work on non-feature tasks, like adding dependencies, name the branch "**random-dependencies**".
